LOG TEXT PROCESSING APPLICATION (JAVA)

Overview:
This project is a small Java application built as part of a coding assessment.
It processes log text files generated by a sports application that may be deployed
in multiple environments and write logs to different systems.

The solution is clean, test-driven, and extensible, following SOLID principles,
so new input sources or output formats can be added easily.

Assessment Requirements:
- Accept a text file as input
- Remove all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from processing
- Count the number of occurrences of the phrase "slow bike" (case-insensitive)
- Count the frequency of each consonant
- Output results to:
    * the console
    * a JSON file
- Code is extendable to support additional outputs in the future

Solution Summary:
- Language: Java 17
- Build Tool: Gradle
- Testing: JUnit 5, AssertJ, Mockito
- JSON Handling: Jackson

Design Highlights:
- Single Responsibility:
    * TextAnalyzer handles text analysis only
    * InputProcessor handles input sources
    * OutputWriter handles output targets
- Open/Closed Principle:
    * New outputs can be added by implementing OutputWriter
- Dependency Injection:
    * Core logic is testable and decoupled from I/O
- TDD Approach:
    * Unit tests cover analyzer, input processing, and outputs

How to Build and Run:

Prerequisites:
- Java 17 installed
- Gradle (or use the Gradle wrapper)

Build the Project:
> ./gradlew clean build

Run Tests:
> ./gradlew test

Run the Application:
1. Place a text file (e.g., input.txt) anywhere on your system
2. Run the main application class (example):
> java -jar build/libs/log-processor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar input.txt

Output:
- Prints consonant counts and "slow bike" count to the console
- Writes the same results to a JSON file

Debugging:
- The application can be debugged by running it directly from an IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse)
- Core logic is isolated and covered by unit tests, making failures easy to trace

Deployment Notes:
- Packaged as a standard JAR
- Can be deployed:
    * As a standalone CLI tool
    * Inside a container
    * As part of a larger log-processing pipeline
- Modular design allows easy integration with other log sources and output systems

Extensibility:
- To add a new output (e.g., database, HTTP endpoint):
    * Create a new class extending OutputWriter
    * No changes required to existing analyzers or processors
