LOG PROCESSOR – JAVA INTERVIEW EXERCISE

Overview
This application processes log files generated by a sports application that may be
deployed in multiple environments and write logs to different systems.

The solution focuses on clean design, testability, and extensibility rather than
production packaging.

Functional Requirements
- Accept a text file as input
- Remove all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from processing
- Count occurrences of the phrase "slow bike" (case-insensitive)
- Count the frequency of each consonant
- Output results to:
    - Console
    - JSON file
- Design allows additional output formats to be added easily

Technology
- Java 17
- Gradle
- JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ
- Jackson (JSON serialization)

Design Notes
- Separation of concerns:
    - InputProcessor: input sources
    - TextAnalyzer: analysis logic
    - OutputWriter: output targets
- Follows SOLID principles
- Dependencies are injected to keep components testable
- Developed using a TDD approach

How to Build
Prerequisites:
- JDK 17 installed

Build:
> ./gradlew clean build

Run Tests:
> ./gradlew test

How to Run the Application
- Run the main class:
  com.asc.exercise.log.processor.LogProcessorApplication

- The application will prompt for:
    - Input text file path
    - Output JSON file path

- Output:
    - Consonant counts and "slow bike" count printed to the console
    - JSON output written to the specified location

Debugging
- Can be run and debugged directly from an IDE
- Core logic is isolated and covered by unit tests

Deployment Notes
- Packaged as a standard Java application
- Can be embedded into other systems or extended with new output targets

Extensibility
- New outputs can be added by extending OutputWriter
- No changes required to existing analysis or input logic
